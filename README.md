Lux Sumus is a short Unity 3D low-poly styled beat'em up game made in C# for Windows.

This game was created in 2015 by 3 Game Development students at Positivo University as an undergraduate final project for the Digital Game Technology Program.
The game's intention was to display, in sort of a tutorial level, different Game Design skills such as Level Design, UI Design and Combat Design, which later
were paired with proper Game Design documentation. The project was a success as the examination board approved the game and the documentation without reservations.
